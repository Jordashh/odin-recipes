                <ol>

                   <li>Build a campfire and allow the fire to burn until it has accumulated a bed of coals. Place a grate over the fire. Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0O3Bj8JFcTc">here</a> for a tutorial on how to build a fire from the experts at REI!</li>
                   <li>Place a 12-inch cast iron Dutch oven onto the grate.</li>
                   <li>Add sausage, onion, and garlic.</li>
                   <li>Cook and stir until sausage is browned and crumbly and onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
                   <li>Stir in hash browns and bell peppers until well mixed</li>
                   <li>Cook, stirring occasionally, until hash browns are hot and peppers are tender, about 15 minutes.</li>
                   <li>Pour beaten eggs into the Dutch oven, allowing them to seep down to the bottom.</li>
                   <li>Cover the Dutch oven and place it directly onto 5 to 10 hot coals.</li>
                   <li>Place another 12 to 18 hot coals on top of the Dutch oven lid.</li>
                   <li>Let cook until eggs are firm, about 40 minutes.</li>
                   <li>Open the lid and sprinkle with Cheddar cheese.</li>
                   <li>Cover and continue to cook until cheese has melted, about 5 minutes.</li>
                                  
                </ol>
