# odin-recipes
In this project I will be demonstrating the basics of HTML.

 I will show a website that is simple and easy to navigate. 
 
 The website will have several pages that are all relative links. 
 
 They will house instructions and ingredients for different dishes while also showing images. 
 
 This project will also be accessible via Screen Reader using the correct tags (strong, em, and alt). 
 
 Lastly, I will be demonstrating good use of Commit Messages but Committing at points in time that I feel necessary.
